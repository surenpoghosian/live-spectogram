# Spectrogram Visualizer

# Overview

The Spectrogram Visualizer is an interactive web application built using React and the Web Audio API. It provides a real-time visualization of audio frequencies captured from a user's microphone, displaying a dynamic spectrogram on the screen. This project is designed to offer an engaging and educational experience for users interested in audio processing and visualization.

# Features

- Real-Time Audio Processing: The application captures live audio input from the user's microphone and processes it in real time.
- Dynamic Spectrogram Display: The frequency spectrum of the audio input is visualized as a spectrogram, updating continuously as new audio data is received.
- User-Friendly Interface: With a simple and intuitive design, users can easily start and stop the audio capture and view the spectrogram display.
- Browser Compatibility: The application is compatible with modern web browsers, leveraging the Web Audio API for audio processing.

# Technology Stack

- React: Used for building the user interface and managing application state.
- Web Audio API: Provides powerful audio processing capabilities, enabling real-time analysis of audio data.
- HTML5 Canvas: Utilized for drawing the spectrogram, offering flexibility in visualization design.

# Purpose

This project serves as both a tool for audio analysis and an educational resource for those interested in digital signal processing and web-based audio applications. Whether you're a musician, audio engineer, educator, or enthusiast, the Spectrogram Visualizer offers a unique window into the world of sound.
